@Borderlands something seems very broken with M10 drop rates. Constantly dropping less lot than lower mayhem levels. How is this possible with a +2500% loot modifier on. I swear I'm seeing more greens and blues than anything on boss kills.

@Borderlands something seems kinda broken with M10 drop rates. Constantly pushing less lot than normal mayhem levels. How is this possible with a +2500% loot modifier on. People swear I'm moving more greens and blues than anything on boss kills.
